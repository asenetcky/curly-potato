## How it Started

::: {.incremental}
- Wanted to be a Physician Assistant

    - Loved working with patients

    - Healthcare setting was _not_ for me
      
- As an undergrad had worked alot with `Uconn Community Outreach` 

- Stumbled across Public Health

    - Did _not_ know what it was
        
    - Found out it was a nice combination of many of my interests and values

# Almost seven years working in `Public Health` 

## How it's going

### Epidemiology

### Data Scientist

## What I `love` about Public Health

- melting pot of so many different subject matter experts

  - law, government, it, informatics, healthcare, bench science 

- underdog mentality  

  - how can we help the most people with our limited resources

  - rewards creativity

- lots of oppurtunities to tackle interesting problems in novel ways with data

## What I wish I had known

- applied public health is often different
than the what you study in grad school

- 

## What they don't tell you

- more political than I would have ever imagined

# Opioid Epidemic

## Syndromic Surveillance

## K2

# Covid-19 Pandemic

## Lessons learned

# You're a story teller

## Telling Stories with Data
