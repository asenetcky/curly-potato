# About Me

- Allied Health - Graduated in 2012

- MPH - Graduated in 2018

- Love coffee ‚òï

- Love Camping üèïÔ∏è and the outdoors

- Enjoy learning, and using open source tools 
for programming, analytics and software development

    - Often the reproducibility guy

## How it Started

::: {.incremental}
- Wanted to be a Physician Assistant

    - Loved working with patients

    - Healthcare setting was _not_ for me
      
- As an undergrad had worked alot with `Uconn Community Outreach` 

- Stumbled across Public Health

    - Did _not_ know what it was
        
    - Found out it was a nice combination of many of my interests and values

# Almost seven years working in `Public Health`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I learned some things along the way that I want to share.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How it's going

## What I `love` about Public Health

# What I wish I had known

## It *IS* possible!

-   There are excellent *free* resources out there

-   Almost everything you need to know is in [R Packages 2nd Edition](https://r-pkgs.org/)

::: notes
I just didn't hear this enough, but it is possible and if the pros I mention later on in the presentation are critical to your projects, then I strongly encourage you to give package building a try.

# Opioid Epidemic

## Syndromic Surveillance

## K2

# Covid-19 Pandemic

# What's gained by making an R package?

## **Reproducibility**


------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   R package build tools allow users to check, and ensure that the package it will run on just about any machine that is required

-   Building a package forces users to write out that documentation we so often skip over

    -   Makes it easier for others to use and *understand* your code

    -   Makes you a better teammate


# What they don't tell you

# You're a story teller
