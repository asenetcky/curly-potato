# About Me

- Allied Health - Graduated in 2012

- MPH - Graduated in 2018

- Love coffee ‚òï

- Love Camping üèïÔ∏è and the outdoors

- Enjoy learning, and using open source tools 
for programming, analytics and software development

    - Often the reproducibility guy

## How the Journey Started

::: {.incremental}
- Wanted to be a Physician Assistant

    - Loved working with patients

    - Healthcare setting was _not_ for me
      
- As an undergrad had worked alot with `Uconn Community Outreach` 

- Stumbled across Public Health

    - Did _not_ know what it was
        
    - Found out it was a nice combination of many of my interests and values

# Almost seven years working in `Public Health`

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I learned some things along the way that I want to share.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How it's going

## What I `love` about Public Health

This presentation isn't about `strata` but if you want to check it out, please do at: <https://asenetcky.github.io/strata/>

::: notes
I'm not here to promote strata, and we won't be covering it in depth. I will say that it is a 
:::

# What I wish I had known

## It *IS* possible!

-   There are excellent *free* resources out there

-   Almost everything you need to know is in [R Packages 2nd Edition](https://r-pkgs.org/)

::: notes
I just didn't hear this enough, but it is possible and if the pros I mention later on in the presentation are critical to your projects, then I strongly encourage you to give package building a try.

# Opioid Epidemic

## Syndromic Surveillance

-   The R package can just be a small family of functions, it does **not** need to be the next `tidyverse`

-   The R package just needs to be useful to *you and your team*

-   It does *not* need to go up to the CRAN

## K2

If I had started honing this skill years ago, I would saved myself alot of headaches down the road.

# What's gained by making an R package?

## **Reproducibility**

-   Building a package bundles up all your code *AND* your dependencies

    -   No more endless `source()` calls to helper scripts and functions

-   Users can enforce strict versioning of dependencies

------------------------------------------------------------------------

-   R package build tools allow users to check, and ensure that the package it will run on just about any machine that is required

-   Building a package forces users to write out that documentation we so often skip over

    -   Makes it easier for others to use and *understand* your code

    -   Makes you a better teammate


# What they don't tell you



# You're a story teller

## **Portability**

Building a package means that the code and documentation can be easily shared with others publicly and privately.

-   No more emailing code around

-   No more asking permission to access share drives or folders

-   No more manually cutting and pasting code all over the place

## **Clarity and Organization**

-   The package structure forces you to organize your code in a way that is easy to understand and use

-   The documentation lives alongside the code, making it easier to understand what the code does

-   Build tools allow pieces of documentation to be used over and over again

    -   Update once, and it updates everywhere

    -   Consistent language throughout

# Sharing R Packages

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Getting an R Package requires alot of work and overheard that might not be worth it for a small project. However, users can still share their project with others it does not need to be on the CRAN.

## Distributing your Package

Sharing your R package is easy to do with `git` and a repository hosting service.

-   [Github](https://github.com/)

-   [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/)

-   [Azure Devops](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/devops)

-   [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)

## Sharing Publicly

You may remember Chuck showing off the `pak` package in a previous meeting. Once an R package is hosted in a remote repository, `pak` is just about all users need to install the package.

-   `pak::pak("<GITHUB USERNAME>/<PACKAGE NAME>")`

-   install the development version of `strata`:

    -   `pak::pak("asenetcky/strata")`

## Sharing Privately

-   The `remotes` package is a great way to install packages from a private repository.

-   For example we have a private CT DPH `odp` R package for internal use only that is hosted in our Azure Devops Project.

-   Installing that would look something like:

    -   `remotes::install_git("<REPO CLONE URL>", git = "external)`

# One last note on Reproducibility

## What we don't have

-   Most of us *do not* have access to the fanciest tools and services

-   Most of us *are not* allowed to spool up a docker image, or server for development

## What we do have

-   Most of us have access to R

-   Most of us have access to git (whether we realize it or not)

## Pulling it all together

If users combine:

-   R

-   git

-   Your own R Package

-   `renv` package

Users *will* have a powerful combination of tools where reproducibility is paramount.
